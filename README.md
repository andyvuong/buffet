# Buffet

Buffet is a collection of web-related architectural patterns that I find myself reusing often. I've put the most basic working examples as sub-directories in this repository.

## Motivation
I often have found myself rewriting the same old CRUD application or web server for various side projects, school assignments, and hackathon projects. I've decided to aggregate some of the more general and common architectures in one repository. Ideally, they're designed in such a way that one can take one or multiple components to piece together a coherent web application. 

## Contributing
Feel free to make a PR if you find any issues with the templates.
