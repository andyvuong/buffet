## Nodeserver Overview

A package containing the barebone project directory structure for a simple node server and restful api. A single api route, /api/simple, is defined and contains empty HTTP request handlers.

### Developing

This package and its dependency should work right off the bat with the basic-web development environment provided [here](https://github.com/andyvuong/dev-environment). I recommend using Vagrant and friends if you're new to web development and wish to keep your development machine clean. The more experienced web developer can modify this package to suit their own tastes. If you don't want to install Vagrant, just make sure you can install the dependencies from install.sh in basic-web.
